**Submit your paper**: [Open the Science on OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=openthescience.org)

## Prerequisites for Submission

### Preprint Requirement

**Before submitting to Open the Science, your paper MUST be available on one of the following preprint servers:**

#### Life Sciences & Medicine
- **bioRxiv** (biology, life sciences): [https://www.biorxiv.org](https://www.biorxiv.org)
- **medRxiv** (health sciences, medicine): [https://www.medrxiv.org](https://www.medrxiv.org)

#### Physical Sciences & Mathematics
- **arXiv** (physics, mathematics, computer science): [https://arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org)
- **ChemRxiv** (chemistry): [https://chemrxiv.org](https://chemrxiv.org)

#### Other Disciplines
- **SSRN** (social sciences): [https://www.ssrn.com](https://www.ssrn.com)
- **OSF Preprints** (multidisciplinary): [https://osf.io/preprints](https://osf.io/preprints)

### Preprint Guidelines
1. **Upload First**: Submit to appropriate preprint server before applying to Open the Science
2. **DOI Required**: Provide the preprint DOI in your OpenReview submission
3. **Version Control**: We accept papers based on any version of your preprint

## Review Process

### Double-Blind Peer Review

Open the Science employs a **double-blind review process** to ensure fair and unbiased evaluation:

#### For Authors
- Remove all author names and affiliations from the manuscript
- Avoid self-citations that reveal identity
- Use anonymous language when referring to previous work
- Ensure institutional acknowledgments are removed

#### For Reviewers
- Reviewer identities remain confidential during review
- Reviews are attributed only after publication decision
- Constructive, professional feedback is expected
- Conflicts of interest must be declared

### Review Timeline
- **Initial Review**: 4-6 weeks
- **Revision Period**: 2-3 weeks (if required)
- **Final Decision**: 1-2 weeks after revision
- **Total Timeline**: Typically 8-11 weeks per cycle

## Privacy and Confidentiality

### Protection of Rejected Submissions

**Your privacy is protected:**

- **Rejected papers are never made public**
- **Author identities of rejected submissions remain confidential**
- **Review comments for rejected papers are not published**
- **No record of rejected submissions appears on our platform**

### Accepted Papers
- Author names and affiliations are revealed upon acceptance
- Peer review comments become public as part of the publication record
- Full transparency in the post-acceptance process

## Post-Acceptance Requirements

### Validation and Resubmission

**After acceptance, you must:**

1. **Update Your Preprint**
   - Upload the peer-reviewed version to your original preprint server
   - Include all revisions made during the review process
   - Update the preprint with the final accepted version

2. **Version Documentation**
   - Clearly indicate this is the "peer-reviewed version"
   - Reference the Open the Science publication
   - Maintain link between preprint and final publication

3. **Final Publication**
   - We will publish the final version on our platform
   - Include links to both preprint and final versions
