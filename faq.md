# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Open the Science?
Open the Science (#OST) is a community-driven platform for open science publishing and collaboration. We provide a space for researchers to publish their work without paywalls, engage in transparent peer review, and collaborate with colleagues worldwide.

### Who can use this platform?
Anyone interested in science! Our platform is open to:
- Academic researchers at any career stage
- Industry scientists and R&D professionals  
- Independent researchers and citizen scientists
- Graduate students and postdocs
- Science enthusiasts and advocates

### Is this platform really free?
Yes, absolutely. Publishing and accessing content on our platform is completely free. We believe science should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial resources.

### How do you fund this platform?
Our platform is supported by:
- Volunteer contributions from the community
- Open-source development model
- Potential future grants and donations
- We will never use paywalls or publication fees

## Publishing Questions

### What can I publish here?
We welcome various types of scientific content:
- Research briefs and short papers
- Preprints and works in progress
- Replications and negative results
- Data papers and software releases
- Review articles and commentaries
- Educational materials and tutorials

### What are research briefs?
Research briefs are concise, focused publications that present scientific findings in an accessible format. They're typically shorter than traditional journal articles but maintain the same scientific rigor.

### How do I submit a research brief?
Currently, submissions are handled through our GitHub repository. We're developing a more user-friendly submission system. For now:
1. Fork our repository
2. Add your brief to the `_research-briefs` folder
3. Submit a pull request
4. Our community will review and provide feedback

### What format should my submission be in?
We accept submissions in Markdown format, which allows for easy formatting and integration with our platform. We provide templates and guidelines to help you format your work correctly.

### How long does the review process take?
Our goal is to complete reviews within 2-3 weeks. The exact timeline depends on:
- Reviewer availability
- Complexity of the research
- Number of revision rounds needed
- Community engagement with the submission

## Peer Review Questions

### How does your peer review process work?
Our peer review process is:
- **Open**: Reviewer identities are known
- **Transparent**: Reviews and responses are public
- **Collaborative**: Authors and reviewers work together to improve the research
- **Community-driven**: The scientific community participates in quality assessment

### Who reviews the submissions?
Our volunteer reviewers include:
- Experts in relevant scientific fields
- Experienced researchers from academia and industry
- Community members with relevant expertise
- We match reviewers based on their background and the submission topic

### Can I see the reviews of published work?
Yes! All reviews, reviewer responses, and editorial decisions are published alongside the research brief. This transparency helps readers understand the quality and reliability of the work.

### How do I become a reviewer?
Join our Reviewers Club by:
1. Expressing interest through our GitHub discussions
2. Providing your background and areas of expertise
3. Completing a reviewer profile
