# About Open the Science

## Our Story

The Open Science Publishing Club (#OST) was born out of frustration with the current state of scientific publishing. Too much valuable research remains locked behind paywalls, inaccessible to those who could benefit most from it. Too many brilliant minds are excluded from the scientific conversation because they can't afford journal subscriptions or publication fees.

**We said: "Just open the f*** science."**

## What We Do

### üîì Open Access Publishing
We provide a platform for researchers to publish their work without paywalls or restrictive licensing. Every research brief published here is freely accessible to anyone, anywhere in the world.

### üë• Community-Driven Peer Review
Our reviewers club brings together experts from diverse backgrounds to provide constructive, transparent peer review. We believe good science comes from open dialogue and collaborative improvement.

### üåç Global Collaboration
We connect researchers across disciplines, institutions, and borders. Science knows no boundaries, and neither should scientific collaboration.

### üìä Transparent Process
All our processes are open and transparent. From submission to publication, researchers and readers can see how decisions are made and how science progresses.

## Our Values

- **Accessibility**: Science should be free and open to all
- **Transparency**: Research processes should be clear and reproducible
- **Collaboration**: The best science happens when minds work together
- **Innovation**: We embrace new ways of doing science
- **Inclusivity**: Everyone has a place in the scientific community
